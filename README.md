Wasim
=====================

## Introduction
Wasim is a web-based tool for semi-automatic morphosyntactic annotation of inflectional languages resources. It features high flexibility in segmenting tokens, editing, diacritizing, and labelling tokens and segments. 

## Motivation
Text annotation of highly inflectional languages (including Arabic) requires key functionality which we could not see in a survey of existing tools. 

## Features
- Wasim integrates with morphological analysers to speed up the annotation process by selecting one from its proposed analyses. 
- It integrates as well with external POS taggers for kick-start annotation and adaptive predicting based on annotations made so far. 
- It aims to speed up the annotation by completely relying on keyboard, with no mouse interaction required. 

Wasim has been tested on four case studies and these features proved to be useful.

## Demo
